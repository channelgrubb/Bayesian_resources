#Resources for Bayesian Data Analysis and Machine Learning

<hr></hr>

As I learn and work my way through Bayesian data analysis and machine learning methods, I have accumulated some good resources. I'd like to share those. They include books, articles, references, videos, repos, people, etc.

#Books
* [***Doing Bayesian Data Analysis***](https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Bayesian-Data-Analysis-Second/dp/0124058884/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8): If you are going to buy just one book to become familiar with the basic (and not so basic dimensions of Bayesian data analysis, this should be that book. If I were to recommend only one resource, it would be this book.
* [***Analysis Regression Multilevel/Hierarchical Models***](https://www.amazon.com/Analysis-Regression-Multilevel-Hierarchical-Models/dp/052168689X)
* ***[Bayesian Data Analysis (3rd edition)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1439840954/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=1944687642&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=052168689X&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=D4T1RWFQVAHC6RZ1BDWW)***
* [***Statistical Rethinking***](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Rethinking-Bayesian-Examples-Chapman/dp/1482253445/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1466909207&sr=1-1&keywords=statistical+rethinking): this book is quickly marching toward the top of my list of 'must-haves.' [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/) - prominent user and advocate of Bayesian data analysis and statistical modeling methods describes it as "a fun and inspiring look at the hows, whats, and whys of statistical modeling."[^GelmanQuote] Here, here! I'll confess to not having worked my way through the entire book, but what I've seen so far, I really, really like. For example, the discussion on Information Theory and its use on model assessment is indispensible (see ch. 6). 

	Also, there is a associated *R* package that includes the ability to call [Stan](http://mc-stan.org) on a model that is specified in *R*'s modeling language without having to write a separate Stan model. While I haven't fully explored this functionality, it seems remarkably handy so far.

* [***Bayesian Reliability***](https://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Reliability-Springer-Statistics-Michael/dp/0387779485/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1466909234&sr=1-1&keywords=Bayesian+Reliability)
* [***An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR)***](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/): Although not 'Bayesian' per se, it is still an essential resource for learning the basics of statistical/machine learning. It is written exceptionally well, clear prose, helpful graphics, *R* labs, and good exercises for students. Plus there is a **FREE** .pdf version available through the book's website.
* [***Elements of Statistical Learning (ESLR)***](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) The more technical, thorough, and expansive treatment of the topics introduced in ISLR. There is also a **FREE** .pdf version available in the link above. This is an indispensible reference.
