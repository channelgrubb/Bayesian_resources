# Bayesian Resources

<hr></hr>

As I learn and work my way through Bayesian data analysis and machine learning methods, I have accumulated some good resources. I'd like to share those. They include books, articles, references, videos, repos, people, etc.

#Books
* [***Doing Bayesian Data Analysis***](https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Bayesian-Data-Analysis-Second/dp/0124058884/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8): If you are going to buy just one book to become familiar with the basic (and not so basic dimensions of Bayesian data analysis, this should be that book. If I were to recommend only one resource, it would be this book.
